    <h1>Beans Recipe</h1>

    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This is the beans recipe I use for my weekly beans dish! Mexican
        style beans are the beans I grew up with and have been cooking for
        the past ten years. By following this recipe you will create a
        healthy bean soup, full of protein, fiber, vitamins and minerals.
        Once the soup is made, you can enjoy it with queso
        fresco, or you can add more flavor with further preparation.
        I like to prepare them further in two different ways, both
        flavorful in their own ways!
